# Tiny302
A Minimal Single Board Computer based on MC68302
This is a more detailed description of the Tiny302 thread on EASy68K forum: http://www.easy68k.com/EASy68Kforum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=1574
The purpose is to build a minimal 68000 system that's simple enough to put together as a prototype board in an evening of hand wiring.
The components used are through-hole IC's so no advanced soldering techniques are needed to put a Tiny302 board together.
